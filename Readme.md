<h1>Project Motivation</h1>
<p>This project is a capstone project of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program,along with Blog Post,my motivation to select this project as a Capstone becuase my interest is also  in Computer Vision ,where we can recognize the object by the image file </p>
<h1>Repository Contains</h1>
<p>
This repo contains
        <ul>
             <li>
                1 folder name test_images in which there are 16 jpg images for testing purpose
            </li>
            <li> 
            And a Ipynb file name dog_breed where all of the code is programed
            </li> 
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Libraries </h1>
<p>
Following are the <b>Main libraries </b> that is used in the project
<ul>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>OpenCV</li>
<li>Tensorflow,Keras</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Sklearn</li>
<li>Glob</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Result </h1>
<p>
The result was the pretty good and gives accuracy of 79 % with 40 epochs ,the result may can be improve if the  no. of epochs increase ,I used relu and softmax activation function in the final dense layer ..further more on my blog 
</p>
<h1>Acknowledgement</h1> 
<p>From the project i have found that this is difficult for a model to differentiate a human face and a dog face beacuse both faces have same no of ears nose and mouth,but for a CNN it is easy to differentiate them with differentiate in pixel that both have differnt  </p>
